      # DEV SPECIFIC BINDS
      ### The current easiest way to develop CWA is to live edit a running instance.
      ### To do so, use docker binds to bind the files your working on to their counterparts in the running container.
      ### This will let you see your changes in realtime, test ect. You can use build.sh to prepare images with your changes.
